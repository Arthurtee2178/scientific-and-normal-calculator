Calculator SPA — Standard & Scientific

Files:
- index.html — single-page app with navbar, standard and scientific panels.
- style.css — styles and animations.
- script.js — calculator logic, panel switching, and ripples.

How to run:
Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a simple static server).

Notes:
- Scientific functions expect input in degrees for trig (sin/cos/tan).
- This is a single-file, dependency-free demo. Customize styles or add more functions as needed.
